                <p>
                    Since 2012, JLS Trading Company has been in the business of taking great products and selling them with passion. We operate private label brands in nearly every consumer category from toys to tools to office products to gourmet food.

                    <br/>
                    We are an 8-figure company and are growing just about 50-100% per year with no end in sight. We add dozens of new products every month and are aiming to be a 9-figure company in the not too distant future. Some of our brands:

                <h2>Work for Us(Even from home)</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="#">Learn more - our careers page is probably worth checking out and has a lot of useful information, unlike normal corporate websites.</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting and corporate BS? Sadly, we are probably not the place for you. If however, you want to work with really nice and competent people in a relaxed environment with flexible hours, then you might love it here. We have super low turnover because we take care of our people.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our basic personnel strategy is to hire smart people regardless of their credentials & experience, give them the tools and training they need to be successful, and then get out of their way. It's a lot of fun. If you think you'd be a fit, shoot us an email, and we'll see what happens!

                <h2>Sell to Us</h2>
                <p>
                    We are very experienced with both wholesale buying and marketing new products. If you think your product isn't being marketed to its potential online, then we can probably help. We are happy to put together large orders to make working with us worth your while; we're not low-budget tire kickers, despite our founder being a cheap bastard - don't tell him I said that!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We are good, easy people to deal with, and we pay our bills on-time (credit references available upon request).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Let's do some business!

                <h2>Why is Your Website Ugly?</h2>
                <p>
                    OK first off, ouch. I'll have you know that the founder's college roommate's teenage cousin spent A LOT of time designing this. She tried her best, damnit.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Second, most corporate websites are just plain terrible at their primary purpose: communicating information. One-page (or two in our case) websites are actually very effective at achieving their limited goal of communicating the information we want to communicate.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Further, we don't want to trick anyone into thinking that we are a company that prioritizes aesthetics over functionality. We are practical people with practical concerns, so if you need a fancy (and expensive) office space/corporate website/indoor plumbing to be happy, we probably aren't the place for you. <em> Karen from HR made me say that we do actually have indoor plumbing. She's no fun.</em>
